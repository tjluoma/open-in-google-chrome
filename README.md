open-in-google-chrome: AppleScripts to send the current URL in Safari to Google Chrome
=====================

I wrote an article on [TUAW] about using AppleScript to send the current web page from Safari to Google Chrome.

This was an idea I had based on an article on [Daring Fireball] where John Gruber described that he used Google Chrome whenever he ran into a page which required Flash. 

(Long story short: Apple no longer includes Adobe Flash in OS X, but Google Chrome comes with Adobe Flash already installed, so if you have Google Chrome, you have Flash.)

[John C. Welch] (aka [@bynkii]) helped me out by giving me the first version of this AppleScript.

I created a second version based on information I found at [StackOverflow].

A TUAW reader named "Rob" gave me a third version. (Unfortunately TUAW has since switched its commenting section and we seem to have lost Rob's comment.)

Most recently, [Jolin Warren] wrote to TUAW and offered yet another solution to this.

I decided that it made sense to start a Github repository for this, since it might need to be changed in the future.

I am going to use Jolin's version as the primary, since it is the most current, but I wanted to include the others as reference, as in appreciation for the help that others offered.
